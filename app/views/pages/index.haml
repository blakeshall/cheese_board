        Cheddar on Status Board

      Simple web app that allows you to show Cheddar task lists
      on Panic's new Status Board iPad app.

      %span.label.label-important WARNING!
      Signing into this will make ALL of your Cheddar lists public. Even though
      you still need to know the list id, it is still public and I for one
      don't think security through obscurity is enough. I'm hoping to implement
      something better soon, but it is also an issue with Status Board only
      working with public URLs.

      Alternatively, you can download and run Cheese Board locally to limit
      exposure to your local network, but this means the table will only render
      while on the same network.

      to sign in below and try it out.
